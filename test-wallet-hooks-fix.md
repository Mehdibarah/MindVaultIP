# React Hooks Order Violation - FIXED! ✅

## 🐛 **The Problem:**
The WalletProvider component was violating the Rules of Hooks by calling `useMemo` after a conditional return (`if (!mounted) return null`). This caused React to detect a change in the order of hooks between renders.

## 🔧 **The Fix:**

### Before (❌ Broken):
```javascript
export function WalletProvider({ children }) {
  // ... hooks ...
  
  // Return null until mounted to prevent hydration mismatch
  if (!mounted) {
    return null  // ❌ Early return before all hooks
  }

  const value = useMemo(() => ({  // ❌ Hook called after conditional return
    // ...
  }), [dependencies])

  return <WalletContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</WalletContext.Provider>
}
```

### After (✅ Fixed):
```javascript
export function WalletProvider({ children }) {
  // ... hooks ...
  
  // Always call useMemo - hooks must be called in the same order every time
  const value = useMemo(() => ({
    address: mounted ? address : null,
    isConnected: mounted ? isConnected : false,
    chainId: mounted ? chainId : null,
    isBaseChain: mounted ? (chainId === base.id) : false,
    connect,
    disconnect,
    shortAddress,
    isValidAddress,
    persistedAddress,
    mounted, // Expose mounted state for components that need it
  }), [address, isConnected, chainId, persistedAddress, mounted])

  // Always render the provider, but with loading state until mounted
  return (
    <WalletContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </WalletContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

## 🎯 **Key Changes:**

1. **✅ Moved `useMemo` before any conditional returns**
2. **✅ Always render the provider** (no more `return null`)
3. **✅ Handle loading state within the context value**
4. **✅ Expose `mounted` state** for components that need it
5. **✅ Separated effects** to avoid conditional hook calls

## 🧪 **Test Results:**

- **✅ No more React Hooks order violations**
- **✅ No more "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" errors**
- **✅ Application loads successfully (HTTP 200)**
- **✅ Wallet context works properly across all pages**
- **✅ SSR hydration works without mismatches**

## 🚀 **Benefits:**

- **Consistent Hook Order**: All hooks are called in the same order every render
- **Better SSR Support**: No more hydration mismatches
- **Cleaner Error Handling**: No more React warnings in console
- **Improved Performance**: Proper memoization without hook violations
- **Better Developer Experience**: Clean console without React warnings

## 📱 **Usage:**

Components can now safely use the wallet context without worrying about hook order violations:

```javascript
import { useWallet } from '@/components/wallet/WalletContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { address, isConnected, mounted, connect } = useWallet();
  
  // Safe to use - no hook order violations
  if (!mounted) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>; // Handle loading state
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isConnected ? `Connected: ${address}` : 'Not connected'}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The React Hooks order violation has been completely resolved! 🎉
