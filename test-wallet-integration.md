# Wallet Integration Test Guide

## ✅ Wallet State Management Fixed

The wallet connection detection issue has been resolved across all pages. Here's what was implemented:

### 🔧 **Enhanced Configuration:**

1. **✅ Wagmi Config** (`src/lib/wagmi.ts`):
   - Enabled SSR support (`ssr: true`)
   - Added localStorage persistence
   - Single shared configuration across the app

2. **✅ Wallet Context** (`src/components/wallet/WalletContext.jsx`):
   - Enhanced with localStorage persistence (`mvip:wallet:address`)
   - Added helper functions (`shortAddress`, `isValidAddress`)
   - Better state management with `useMemo`
   - SSR hydration guards

### 🎯 **Updated Pages:**

3. **✅ CreateProof Page** (`src/pages/CreateProof.jsx`):
   - Removed duplicate wallet connection logic
   - Now uses global `useWallet()` hook
   - Added direct connect button in wallet prompt
   - Consistent wallet state across navigation

4. **✅ New Signup Page** (`src/pages/Signup.jsx`):
   - Demonstrates proper wallet integration
   - Shows wallet connection status
   - Form validation requires connected wallet
   - Real-time wallet state updates

### 🧪 **Test Scenarios:**

#### Test 1: Cross-Page Wallet Detection
1. **Connect wallet** on any page (e.g., `/Messages`)
2. **Navigate to `/Signup`** → Wallet address should appear immediately
3. **Navigate to `/CreateProof`** → Should show connected state
4. **No page refresh needed** → State persists across navigation

#### Test 2: Wallet State Persistence
1. **Connect wallet** on any page
2. **Refresh the page** → Wallet should remain connected
3. **Close and reopen browser** → Wallet state should persist (localStorage)
4. **Disconnect wallet** → State should clear everywhere

#### Test 3: Form Validation
1. **Go to `/Signup`** without wallet connected
2. **Try to submit form** → Should show "Connect wallet first" message
3. **Connect wallet** → Form should become submittable
4. **Disconnect wallet** → Form should become disabled again

### 🔍 **Key Features:**

- **✅ Single Source of Truth**: All pages use the same wallet context
- **✅ SSR Safe**: Proper hydration guards prevent mismatches
- **✅ Persistent State**: localStorage keeps wallet connected across sessions
- **✅ Real-time Updates**: Wallet changes reflect immediately on all pages
- **✅ Helper Functions**: `shortAddress()` and `isValidAddress()` utilities
- **✅ Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for connection issues

### 🚀 **Usage in Any Component:**

```javascript
import { useWallet } from '@/components/wallet/WalletContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    address, 
    isConnected, 
    connect, 
    disconnect, 
    shortAddress,
    isValidAddress 
  } = useWallet();

  return (
    <div>
      {isConnected ? (
        <p>Connected: {shortAddress(address)}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connect}>Connect Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 📱 **Pages That Now Have Reliable Wallet Detection:**

- ✅ **Signup** (`/Signup`) - New page with full wallet integration
- ✅ **CreateProof** (`/CreateProof`) - Updated to use global context
- ✅ **Messages** (`/Messages`) - Uses global wallet state
- ✅ **Marketplace** (`/Marketplace`) - Uses global wallet state
- ✅ **All other pages** - Can now reliably detect wallet connection

### 🎉 **Result:**

The "Signup pages do not detect connected wallet" issue is now completely resolved. Users can:

1. **Connect wallet on any page**
2. **Navigate to any other page** (including signup/registration)
3. **See their wallet address immediately** without page refresh
4. **Have persistent wallet state** across browser sessions
5. **Get real-time updates** when wallet connection changes

The wallet state is now truly global and reliable across the entire application!
